# Mad Lib Exercise
## Project Description
This project for my web development bootcamp is meant to practice 
basic javascript concepts while practicing template literals, variable declaration, object manipulation, boolean expressions, and how to use them.

## Objectives
1. **Understand Template Literals:** Learn how to use template literals (``) to *dynamically insert variables into a string*.

2. **Variable Declaration and Assignment:** Practice *declaring variables* using const and let.

3. **Manipulating Objects:** Learn how to *define objects* with properties and access them using dot notation.

4. **Boolean Expressions:** Understand how to write and evaluate *boolean expressions* to represent logical conditions.

## Expected Output/Usage
Users will be able to change the variables that are shown to whatever they want and therefore change the story. 


## Technology Used
- HTML: Allow for the story to be displayed on a webpage
- Javascript: In order to declare the variables that are being changed and then display the madlib story

## Next Steps
Allow for the user to see which parts of the story can be changed and change the story on the webpage itself instead of having to go to the actual code and make the changes on the javascript file.
